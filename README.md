# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
------------------------------

An analysis of a marketing campaign and its different transmission channels, as well as total sales and new users, to achieve greater efficiency when investing in advertising.

# The Campaign

In this project, our client, an online store, completed a week-long, multichannel marketing campaign designed to test messaging and customer response across a range of featured products.

The campaign included two versions of messages:

## Campaign A used a casual, conversational tone:

## Campaign B used a more promotional, sales-oriented tone:

The client used three marketing channels:

Email

Instagram

Website banner

## What the client wants to know:

“Which campaign and channel combination should we focus on to increase sales to new customers, and why?”

# The base CSV file
The Marketing_Campaign_Data.csv file contains records of marketing interactions from the weekly campaign; these records will be used to analyze the effectiveness of different campaigns and channels.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the dataset's structure and contents:

## Column Overview
The dataset consists of 7 columns:

Interaction ID: A unique identifier for each customer interaction.

Campaign Type: Categorical variable with two groups, likely representing an A/B test.

Channel: The marketing platform used for the interaction.

Customer Type: Classification of the customer.

Converted (1=yes, 0=no): A binary indicator of whether the interaction led to a conversion.

Time on Site (seconds): The duration the user spent on the site.

Sales ($): The revenue generated from the interaction.

# Excel Analysis and Dashboard
The CSV file was converted to XLSX, and a table was created with the data. Several pivot tables were then created to obtain the following metrics:

Sum of total sales.

User type.

Percentage of converted sales.

Total sales by channel and campaign.

Total sales by campaign.

Total sales by channel.

A dashboard was then created with the obtained metrics:

# Results and Recommendations

The analysis performed on marketing campaigns A and B and their different transmission channels, with the objective of determining the best option when investing in advertising, concluded that campaign B via email is the best option when attracting new users, followed by campaign A via email, campaign B via Instagram, and campaign B via web banner.

The analysis revealed total sales from new users totaling $988,528.51 and a total of 42,597 new users with a purchase rate of 47.86%.

Campaign B via email acquired 9,700 new users and generated sales of $225,285.52, making it the most effective campaign in terms of acquiring new users and converting sales.
